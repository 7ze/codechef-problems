/**
Problem
  Chef decided to redecorate his house, and now needs to decide between two
  different styles of interior design. For the first style, tiling the floor
  will cost X1 rupees and painting the walls will cost Y1 rupees. For the
  second style, tiling the floor will cost X2 rupees and painting the walls
  will cost Y2 rupees. Chef will choose whichever style has the lower total
  cost. How much will Chef pay for his interior design?

Input Format
  The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number
  of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing
  4 space-separated integers X1,Y1,X2,Y2 as described in the statement.


Output Format
  For each test case, output on a new line the amount Chef will pay for interior
  design.

Constraints
    1 ≤ T ≤ 100
    1 ≤ X1, Y1, X2, Y2 ≤ 100
